# Notes App

A simple, browser-based notes application that lets users create, edit, and delete notes with data saved in cookies for persistent storage across sessions. This app is great for personal notes on a single device without requiring server-side storage.

## Features

- **Add Notes**: Easily add new notes.
- **Edit Notes**: Modify existing notes directly in the app.
- **Delete Notes**: Remove notes that you no longer need.
- **Persistent Storage**: Data is stored in cookies, so your notes remain available on the same device even after closing the browser.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure and layout of the app.
- **CSS**: Styling for a clean and responsive UI.
- **JavaScript**: Core functionality, including managing notes and storing data in cookies.
